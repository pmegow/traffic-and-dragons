# todo_checkWithFable.md

**Purpose:** work done by a **non-Fable model** (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) that deserves Fable-eyed
review lands here with its supporting documentation. Two intake classes:

1. **Drift-surface tasks** (CLAUDE.md ▸ drift-protection policy) built by a lighter session —
   always filed, however small.
2. **Fable-budget-exhausted mode (user rule 2026-07-29): while the Fable budget is out, ALL
   Opus work is documented here** — every substantive task, not just drift-surface — so that
   when the budget renews, the whole batch can be triaged in one pass.

**How to file:** one `###`-headed entry under **Pending Fable review** — what shipped (versions,
commits), what it touches, why it's risky or not, supporting docs/tests, and what a reviewer
should probe first. Self-contained enough that a Fable session needs no other context.

**How to review:** `/fable-review <entry>` (validated workflow — see `.claude/skills/fable-review`).
When Fable is satisfied (or files follow-ups), move the entry's full record to
[audits/FABLE_REVIEW_RECORDS.md](audits/FABLE_REVIEW_RECORDS.md) and add one line to the
**Reviewed index** below. This file stays lean; the archive holds the receipts.
